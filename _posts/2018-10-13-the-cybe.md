Some months ago [Teemu Paivinen](https://twitter.com/teempai) and I met for coffee in the center of Helsinki. We discussed all things peer-to-peer and global issues like economics and the internet. Deep into the conversation, as Teemu gazed outside the window trying to grasp for words, he shared that he feels that there is something about the exponential scale of the internet that makes it more important than we realize. Neither of us were able to put in words what that is, but I knew what he was talking about. Yet, it bothered me that we couldn't articulate the idea, and I kept thinking about it weeks later. In this article Teemu and I try to articulate that idea and create the beginnings of a framework for thinking about it.

People often talk about "cyberspace" and other cyber-related words. Cyber- is a prefix that works as an adjective, adding internet connotations to the noun that follows. It points to a known concept, but we rarely talk about what that concept is. What's needed is a noun, not an adjective.

## Graphs

Information science has a foundational mathematical tool, [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). In informal language, a graph is a bunch of dots connected by a bunch of lines, and can be applied to describe cities and highways, computer systems, words and their relationships, etc. The internet is a graph, where nodes are computers and edges are the connections between them. The internet also *contains* also other virtual graphs, like the social graph, where nodes are user accounts and edges are *follow* relationships.

An edge only exists to link two nodes together. Without nodes, there are no edges. So it would logically follow that the nodes are the primary concept in graphs. For years we have fixated our attention on the nodes that make up the internet. We have counted the number of websites, users and views as the core metrics by which we evaluate the utility of the internet.

But we're missing something important. In highly connected graphs, the number of edges is (at most) quadratically larger than the number of nodes. This means that a dense graph with merely 2 thousands nodes could have over a million edges. In other words, a cyberspace with just a humble amount of two thousand people can display more than a million interpersonal connections. A cyberspace with two billion users (e.g. Facebook) could have quadrillions of connections. One quadrillion is a million billion. For a notion of scale, the universe, from big bang to today, is a couple hundred quadrillion seconds old. Imagine this: if you spent one second looking at each interpersonal connection on Facebook, ten thousand years would not be nearly long enough to see them all.

## Edges

We can only estimate the amount of edges on the internet. Doing a simple web search, we can't discover the total number of hyperlinks on all websites, we can't lookup the number of follow relationships on Twitter. We don't seem to be publicly tracking these numbers, but they are fundamental in describing the value of a cyberspace. A system with 2000 isolated individuals is nowhere near as valuable as a system with 2000 highly-interconnected persons.

At scale, **the number of edges becomes an entity in itself**, no longer conceptually dependent on the nodes. This is what I describe as the **Cybe**: it is the set of edges in any very large and dense graph. A cybe is influential enough to be considered an entity apart from its constituents.

## TODO

(I deleted the other sentences but still have them lying around. I think we should rewrite from this point onwards, but following a logical structure, for instance:)

- Example: brain
- Example: internet
- Property: lack of physicality (even though it's an entity)
  - No constituent can take responsibility for the actions of the whole
  - E.g. Zuckerberg as an escape goat, when in reality it is nearly impossible to trace down the responsibles
- Property: holobiont (human and non-human)
  - Unlike a hive-mind or 'superorganisms'
  - Is it a competition or a collaboration? (what may seem like short-term competition may serve to increase long-term collaboration)
- Property: emergent collective intelligence (the cybe is already an artificial intelligence)
  - Example achievement: Wikipedia
  - Example: Anonymous hacktivists
  - Example: open source
- The urgency to study the cybe
  - It's changing our societies quicker than we expected
  - Governments are looking for escape goats => won't work
  - Governments are engaging in regulation => won't work
  - A new form of human-machine collectivism on a global scale

## The Cybe

The Cybe is what defines massive scale social dynamics on the internet, where people care less about the individuals involved than they care about congregating within the Cybe. Conceptually this is similar to the idea that the internet is a hive-mind, but there is a disctinction. A hive-mind implies that humanity collectively is in control. It could be a chaotic sort of control, composed of many competing agendas, but control nonetheless.

The Cybe, however, does not automatically assume that anyone is in control. It is the interplay between human and non-human entities, such as artificial intelligence powered ad-networks, taking place on a massive scale and increasing in velocity exponentially. It is no longer clear whether we are the masters or the slaves. In this way, the Cybe is a new form of human-machine collectivism on a global scale.

It may be that we are witnessing the formation of a new kind of society. One that exists partly in the physical world and partly in cyberspace. One led by algorithmic feedback loops rather than human governments. The Cybe.
